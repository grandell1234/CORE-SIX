Total hours so far: 7

- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

## Minimum Printer Requirments

* Print space 310*310.
* Works
* Core-XY Design
* Fully made in 5 days.

### Printer Ideas ( Hope to have most of them done before deadline. )

* The best Multi-Color support ever made for 6 colors that supports MMS, but should eventually have AMS.
* Very Fast
* Good Camera (why do printers not come with these)
* Custom PCB for the light.

| Day  | Task                     | Time      | Notes                                                                           |
| ----- | ------------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 | Researching how 3D printers work, learning about what parts are used in the creation process. | 6 hours    | I spent way to long on this but afterwards I saw how really daunting this project was going to be and considered giving up.|
| 2 | Assembling a list of all the parts that I think are going to be required and actually creating the Journal. | 4 hours | This project is seeming a lot more possible now, but I will have to see on Day 3 whats going to happen when I start CAD design which is my biggest weakness. |
